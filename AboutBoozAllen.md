## About Booz Allen's Systems Delivery
Booz Allen provides a full-stack, enterprise systems delivery capability and provides high-performing, cross-functional agile teams. We engage and lead across the full lifecyle: from user research and human-centered design, through technical implementation and help-desk support. We employ over 3500 software development staff across a variety of disciplines.

We approach agility with responsibility. Booz Allen maintains a current Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) for Development (CMMI-DEV) Maturity Level 5 appraisal rating for its IT Team Development Organization. Initially achieved in September
2005 through an appraisal led by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) (now known as the CMMI Institute), this rating was most recently refreshed in June 2016 by an external appraiser. The firm has completed 17 consecutive successful CMM/CMMI appraisals.

Booz Allen has applied agile practices for more than 12 years and currently has more than 150 active agile Systems Delivery projects. These projects range in size from small mobile application development efforts to complex enterprise solutions supported by more than 200 project team members.

The firm has invested heavily in training, tools, and resources to facilitate adoption and implementation of the agile mindset and practices. It has partnered with the International Consortium for Agile (ICAgile), Software Education Global, Scaled Agile Academy, and Agile Alliance. We have more than 350 certified Scrum Masters and Project Management Institute (PMI) Agile Certified Practitioners (PMI-ACP), more than 60 SAFe Agilists (SA), and more than 800 ICAgile Certified Professionals (ICP) trained in the agile mindset and practices.

Booz Allen’s SDUniversity program, established in 2015, launched with a _Department of Agile Delivery_, where our staff are able to obtain agile training and certifications across many of these disciplines. Our Agile Community of Practice (CoP) has been in place for nearly 8 years. With more than 1,100 members, it serves as a clearinghouse to share and discover new practices and to stay abreast of emerging trends in the domain. In 2016, the Agile CoP hosted its first _Agile Day at Booz Allen_ internal conference, attended by over 130 Booz Allen practitioners and featuring talks from a dozen of the CoP’s members. Finally, our SmartSuite environment is a set of firmwide enterprise tools, processes, and intellectual capital that can be tailored to support agile delivery in the areas of document management, team collaboration, continuous integration, requirements management, automated code reviews, testing, and defect tracking.
